John Conway’s Game of Life
📖 Overview

The Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by mathematician John Conway.
It is a zero-player game, meaning its evolution is determined entirely by its initial state—no further input is needed.

The game takes place on a grid of cells, where each cell can be:
Alive (1 / filled)
Dead (0 / empty)

Cells evolve through generations based on a set of rules.

🎮 Rules

At each step, the state of each cell is determined by its 8 neighbors:

Underpopulation: Any live cell with fewer than 2 live neighbors dies.

Survival: Any live cell with 2 or 3 live neighbors lives on.

Overpopulation: Any live cell with more than 3 live neighbors dies.

Reproduction: Any dead cell with exactly 3 live neighbors becomes alive.


⚙️ How It Works

Start with an initial pattern (random or user-defined).

The game updates the grid according to the rules.

Patterns emerge, move, or die out automatically.
